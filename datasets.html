<h3><a id="Database" class="anchor" href="#database" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Summary</h3>

<p>We recently completed the PPG Diary Pilot 1 Study, an observational study to assess the feasibility of acquiring PPG data during daily living. The data acquired during this study consist of PPG pulse waves acquired from a single subject for a period of 28 days during daily living. We are currently collating and analysing these data, and intend to make them publicly available in due course.</p>

<p>Whilst this process is ongoing, we have prepared some preliminary subsets of the larger dataset, which are now publicly available.	    

<h3><a id="Preliminary Subsets" class="anchor" href="#prelim_subsets" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Preliminary Subsets</h3>

<p>The following preliminary subsets are currently available in Matlab &reg; format:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b><a href="ppwdb.html">Preliminary Pulse Wave Database</a></b>: Simulated arterial pulse waves from 258 virtual subjects aged from 25 to 75 years old. This is a preliminary version of the dataset, and cannot be considered to be representative of a sample of healthy adults. Nonetheless, it has proved helpful for developing pulse wave analysis algorithms and for gaining insight into arterial haemodynamics.</li>
  <li><b><a href="mental_stress_db.html">Mental Stress Pulse Wave Database</a></b>: Simulated arterial pulse waves from virtual subjects simulated to mimic different levels of mental stress.</li>	
</ul>

<h3><a id="PPG Diary 1 Dataset" class="anchor" href="#ppgdiary1" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>PPG Diary 1 Dataset</h3>

<p>We intend to make the entire dataset from the PPG Diary 1 study available in due course.</p>
