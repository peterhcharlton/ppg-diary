<h3><a id="Database" class="anchor" href="#database" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Summary</h3>

<p>We recently completed the PPG Diary Pilot 1 Study, an observational study to assess the feasibility of acquiring PPG data during daily living. The data acquired during this study consist of PPG pulse waves acquired from a single subject for a period of 28 days during daily living. We are currently collating and analysing these data, and intend to make them publicly available in due course.</p>

<p>Whilst this process is ongoing, we have prepared some preliminary subsets of the larger dataset, which are now publicly available.	    

<h3><a id="Preliminary Subsets" class="anchor" href="#prelim_subsets" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Preliminary Subsets</h3>

      <p>The following preliminary subsets are currently available <a href = "https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3268501">here</a> in Matlab &reg; format:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b><a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3268501/files/PPGdiary1_1_hour_sample.mat?download=1">One hour recording</a></b>: a one-hour recording of simultaneous red and infrared PPG signals during sleep.</li>
  <li><b><a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3268501/files/PPGdiary1_1_min_sample.mat?download=1">One minute recording</a></b>: a one-minute recording of infrared PPG signal during sleep.</li>	
  <li><b><a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3268501/files/PPGdiary1_1_pulse_sample.mat?download=1">Single pulse wave recording</a></b>: a recording of a single pulse wave, acquired using infrared PPG.</li>	
</ul>

<p>We intend to make the entire dataset from the PPG Diary 1 study available in due course.</p>
