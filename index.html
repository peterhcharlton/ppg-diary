<p>The aim of this project is to assess the feasibility of acquiring photoplethysmogram (PPG) data during daily living. The PPG signal is measured by many fitness devices and smart watches. It is a measure of the pulse wave, and is currently used for heart rate monitoring. However, the PPG signal is influenced by a range of cardiovascular factors beyond heart rate alone. Therefore, if it is feasible to acquire PPG data during daily living, then further research could be conducted to develop tools to extract further information from the signal during daily life. If successful, then these tools could be used for health monitoring.</p>
